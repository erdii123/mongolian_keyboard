# Mongolian Keyboard

* 2021 by Erdem Bileg

This keyboard template with mongolian alphabet was created to give mongolian programmers a simple Apple Keyboard to implement.
At the moment, only the keyboard for macOS is published. A standard keyboard template is in progress.

You can use it, make sure that the **CSS and JS files** are connected to your **html-Page**.
